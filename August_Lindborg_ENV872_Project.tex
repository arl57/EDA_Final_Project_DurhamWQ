\section{Rationale and Research
Questions}\label{rationale-and-research-questions}}

Water quality of urban streams and rivers has been studied across the
United States for the past several decades. These evaluations typically
provide important insights about stressors on aquatic systems in urban
environments, particularly natural pollutants such as nutrients,
sediment, and heavy metals, as well as anthropogenic contaminants such
as pesticides and other man-made chemicals. Many cities have programs
dedicated to monitoring the health of local rivers and streams for the
protection of humans and wildlife.

Certain water quality parameters are commonly collected and used to
assess health of urban streams. These include measurements of chemical,
physical, and biological parameters that can be used independently or
together to determine stream health. These parameters are often
evaluated over time to highlight general trends in water quality in
urban environments. In general, health of urban streams in the United
States has been improving since the Clean Water Act was introduced in
the 1970s.

The main objective of our project was to understand current water
quality trends in local urban streams between 2019 and 2020. Eno River
and Ellerbe Creek in Durham, North Carolina were selected for evaluation
in our study. These streams were chosen to provide a local context for
evaluating recent changes in stream health. Additionally, the City of
Durham collects monthly monitoring data for both Eno River and Ellerbe
Creek for several metrics that they provide publicly, making this easily
accessible data. This project includes an evaluation of the most common
surface water quality parameters for which the City of Durham had data,
including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, metals (zinc and copper),
total phosphorus, fecal coliform, turbidity, and total suspended solids.
All sites for each water body evaluated by the City of Durham were
included.

\textbf{Research Question:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\section{Dataset Information}\label{dataset-information}}

The data was collected from the City of Durham's water quality data web
portal. The portal includes data collected by the City's Stormwater
Services as part of the Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Program.
The program performs ambient stream monitoring to assess compliance with
regulatory benchmarks, assess surface water impairment, identify sources
for illicit discharge, and support watershed planning. The monitoring
data includes information regarding the monitoring location, conditions,
weather, and measurements. Nine parameters were chosen for analysis
because of their monthly measurement frequency for 2019 and 2020 at the
two streams of interest. The parameters of interest include Copper,
Dissolved Oxygen, Fecal Coliform, pH, Total Phosphorus, Total Suspended
Solids, Temperature, Turbidity, and Zinc. To extract relevant data from
the portal the stream, water quality parameters, and dates of interest
were selected for the user interface and downloaded to CSV files.

Once datasets for each of the parameters were downloaded, they were read
into R and compiled into a single dataframe. First, a subset of the
dataframe was created to keep only relevant columns for analysis. Next,
the date column to read as a date to enable plotting and time series
analysis. To address duplicate measurements, measurements for the same
parameter, with the same date and monitoring location were averaged.
Then, the parameters measurements were pivoted to include a column for
each of the nine parameters. To map the locations of each of the
monitoring stations, the water quality dataframe was joined with station
coordinates.

\section{Exploratory Analysis}\label{exploratory-analysis}}

As part of the exploratory analysis, water quality data was compiled for
the nine parameters for both the Eno River and Ellerbe Creek. The
following sections describe the exploratory analysis completed for each
waterway.

Both Ellerbe Creek and Eno River have three monitoring stations in
Durham. Sites EN13.3ER, EN8.9ER, and EN4.9ER for Eno River all had data
for 2019, but only \textbf{\emph{(insert sites)}} had data for 2020. For
Ellerbe Creek, sites EL1.9EC, EL5.6EC, and EL7.1EC had data for 2019,
but only EL1.9EC and EL7.1EC had data for 2020.

Visual explorations of the nine water quality parameters for Ellerbe
Creek were conducted to determine how these parameters changed between
2019 and 2020. First, because we are not able to visit the sites, we
wanted to determine what the main site characteristics may be. One main
exploration was the relationship between temperature and cloud cover,
hypothesizing that if temperature is fluctuating with changes in cloud
cover (e.g., temperatures increase on sunny days), this could indicated
minimal riparian vegetation. Minimal riparian vegetation has impacts on
water quality such as increased sedimentation, temperature, and runoff
contamination. At Ellerbe Creek, for all stations, it was observed that
temperature does not appear to change directly in response to cloud
cover (Figure 1). To make any definitive determinations about this
relationship, we would need more finite data than just one sample day
per month.

day for 2019 and 2020.}
\end{figure}

\newpage

We were also interested in the relationship between turbidity and rain,
as an indicator of erosion and to what degree the Ellerbe Creek sites
may be influenced by storm events. Visual comparisons show that there
appears to be an increase in turbidity after rain events, especially in
2020 (Figure 2). Figure 2 also reveals that there may be an increase in
turbidity between 2019 and 2020.

\caption{Turbidity concentrations for rain versus no rain in the last 24
hours for 2019 and 2020. Points represent samples within each group.}
\end{figure}

After completing site explorations, we wanted to look specifically at
water quality parameters between 2019 and 2020. For dissolved oxygen,
there were no distinguishable trends over time and did not appear to be
differences between the sample sites for Ellerbe Creek (Figure 3).

quality standard for dissvoled oxygen.}
\end{figure}

There appeared to be downward trend in pH, particularly throughout the
year for 2020 (Figure 4), which warranted further investigation of this
parameter in the Analysis section.

\end{figure}

Fecal coliform was near the upper water quality limit for both years,
with spikes at both stations in August of both years greatly exceeding
the upper water quality limit of 400 cfu/100mL. There did not appear to
be a difference between the two years (Figure 5). Although we cannot
provide further analysis for the observed peaks, they could be
indicative of specific inputs to the creek around the same time each
year.

Creek stations. Red dotted line represents the upper limit water quality
standard for fecal coliform.}
\end{figure}

Temperature was sporadic, which was expected based on seasonal
variations in ambient air temperature. Temperature fluctuations appeared
similar between both years and did not exceed maximum temperature
thresholds based on current water quality standards for streams of 32
degrees Celcius (Figure 6).

\end{figure}

Total phosphorus appeared to increase throughout the year for both 2019
and 2020, but there did not appear to be an overall change in total
phosphorus between 2019 and 2020 (Figure 7). This is likely seasonal due
to temperature fluctuations and changing inputs throughout the year,
however there were not a sufficient number of data points to conduct
seasonal analyses.

\caption{Total phosphorus concentrations in 2019 and 2020 for Ellerbe

\end{figure}

Total suspended solids appeare to increase between 2019 and 2020, with
drastic spikes in concentrations during the late summer/early fall in
2020 for both sites that were not observed in 2019, when only a small
spike was observed (Figure 8). We were not able to provide further
analysis for why this peak was observed, but it could be due to input
changes around that time of year in 2020 compared to 2019.Further
analysis was conducted on the differences in TSS between 2019 and 2020
and is explained in the Analysis section.

\end{figure}

Turbidity showed the same relationship as TSS, with values in 2020
appearing higher than those in 2019 and drastic peaks observed in late
summer/early fall. In 2019, values did not exceed the upper water
quality limit for turbidity. In 2020, values did exceed the upper limit
for site EL1.9EC in August and September and for site EL7.1EC in August
(Figure 9).

Metal concentrations in Ellerbe Creek were below the water quality
standard for zinc and around or above the water quality standard for
copper. Zinc concentrations appeared to decrease while copper remained
consistent between 2019 and 2020 (Figure 10).

\hypertarget{ph}{%
\subsection{pH}\label{ph}}

Exploratory analysis revealed that pH decreased slightly between 2019
and 2020 for both Ellerbe Creek and Eno River stations. An ANOVA was
conducted to determine the difference in pH between 2019 and 2020 across
all sites for each stream.

For Ellerbe Creek , pH was significantly lower in 2020 compared to 2019
(p-value \textless{} 0.01). However, mean pH for both years is within
what is considered the ``normal'' pH for streams (6-9), as shown by the
upper and lower limits in Figure 4.

The downward trend for both streams is concerning as it may cause pH
levels to dip below the lower limit in future years.

\hypertarget{zinc-copper}{%
\subsection{Zinc \& Copper}\label{zinc-copper}}

An ANOVA conducted to determine the if concentrations differ for metals
between 2019 and 2020 in Ellerbe Creek revealed that there were no
statistical differences between 2019 and 2020 concentrations for zinc
(p-value = 0.22) or copper (p-value = 0.15) across all sites combined.

\hypertarget{turbidity-and-recent-rainfall}{%
\subsection{Turbidity and Recent
Rainfall}\label{turbidity-and-recent-rainfall}}

In Ellerbe Creek, turbidity was significantly higher after rain event in
both 2019 and 2020 (p-values \textless{} 0.01), indicating that erosion
and sedimentation could be an issue for Ellerbe Creek. Additionally,
turbidity was significantly higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (p-value =
0.03).

\hypertarget{total-suspended-solids-tss-and-turbidity}{%
\subsection{Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and
Turbidity}\label{total-suspended-solids-tss-and-turbidity}}

The relationship between turbidity and TSS was conducted as a follow-up
analysis to determine if these measures are correlated. Typically, if
these values are correlated it indicates that observed turbidity and TSS
are the result of increased sediment and particulate matter, and not due
to other factors such as pollutants like dyes that impact one of these
measurements but not the other.

The relationship between TSS and turbidity for Ellerbe Creek is shown in
Figure X. Based on regression analysis, these two values were correlated
across all Ellerbe Creek sites combined in 2019 (p-value \textless{}
0.01, R-squared = 0.76) and 2020 (p-value \textless{} 0.01, R-squared =
0.98), again, indicating sedimentation is an issue.
